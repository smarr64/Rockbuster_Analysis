# Rockbuster Stealth Analysis
This is an analysis of a fictional movie rental company. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate analytical skills in a business context using SQL and Tableau.

## Background and Objectives
Rockbuster has a series of business questions that can be answered using their database. The questions include:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
Rockbuster uses a relational database with the following tables:
- Payment
- Actor
- Customer
- Rental
- Inventory
- Film category
- Staff
- Film_actor
- Cateogory
- Address
- Language

- Country

## Deliverables
This project produced three deliverable items that are included in this repository:
- A Data Dictionary with an ERD and guide to all of the tables
- An Excel sheet with all of the SQL queeries performed and their outputs
- A PowerPOint presentation of the Tableau visualizations produced
